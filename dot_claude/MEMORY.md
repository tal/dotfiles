## Writing Voice Preferences
- Tal prefers first-person, personal phrasing over formal/corporate language
- Use "I really appreciate" or "I love" instead of "shows a commitment to" or "what compels me most is"
- Avoid resume-speak like "bring my experience bridging X and Y to deliver Z"
- Keep it conversational — how you'd say it to a friend, not a cover letter template
